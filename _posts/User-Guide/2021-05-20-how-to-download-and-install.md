Once your Apple ID has been submitted, you will receive an email from TestFlight (see image below) that you will have to view on your iPad to be able to use the Dispatch App for UAT on your device. 

NOTE: If after clicking on the "View in TestFlight" button, the device asks for an AppleID, log into the Apple store with the AppleID submitted.
